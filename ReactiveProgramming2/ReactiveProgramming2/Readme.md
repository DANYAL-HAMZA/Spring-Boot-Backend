This application uses the reactive programming approach to create a product service application.
It exhibits the importance and how reactive programming is implemented in backend systems

## Features
- Product Service

> Get all products
> Get product with range
> Save product
> Update product
> Delete product
### Tech Stack
- Spring boot
- java
- project reactor
> Project reactor allows you to create applications with reactive capabilities such as asynchronous and non-blocking
> communication between services and also an asynchronous, non-blocking requests to the database. This approach brings
> about scalability and handles robustness in heavy applications.
